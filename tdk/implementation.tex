This chapter presents the tools and methods used for implementing a program for calculating the QZMIs of an image using both methods of discretization.

\section{Programming language and libraries}
The implementation was created using the Python programming language and relying on the Numpy and Numba libraries to achieve efficient and fast computation of the moment invariants.

Numpy provided a way to efficiently work with arrays and matrices. It also provided the quaternion package, which supports the quaternion data type.

Using the just-in-time compilation (JIT) features of Numba, the computationally heavy parts of the implementation could be made almost as fast as native code.
