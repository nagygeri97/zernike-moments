In this chapter we describe our proposed approach to the discretization of continuous quaternion Zernike moments. Our aim is to ensure simple and reversible computability, but achieve considerable reduction in potential computational inaccuracies at the same time. For this, we define a system of sampling points $(r_k,\theta_j)$, over which the integral discretization \eqref{QZRMappr} maintains advantageous theoretical properties. The idea behind our approach is motivated by the work \cite{PapSchipp}.
