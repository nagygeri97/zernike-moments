Image moments and moment invariants are widely used for image analysis and pattern recognition. The system of orthogonal Zernike polynomials (defined over the complex unit disc) proved to be a useful basis for series expansions because of certain invariance properties.

Conventionally, for multichannel color images RGB decomposition or grayscale conversion was used. By representing the three basic color channels with quaternions, superior results can be obtained. Previously, rotation, scaling and translation invariant Quaternion Zernike Moment Invariants (QZMIs) have been constructed for use on color images~\cite{qzmi}.

In this thesis we introduce a method of transforming a digital RGB image inside the unit circle onto a discrete orthogonal points system. Using this points system for the discretization of the QZMIs, we have achieved significant improvements in the image recognition and reconstruction capabilities of the method, especially under noisy conditions.
