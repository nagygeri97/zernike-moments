Image moments and moment invariants are widely used for image analysis and pattern recognition. Rotation, scaling and translation invariant Quaternion Zernike Moment Invariants (QZMIs) have been constructed for use on color images~\cite{qzmi}. These moment invariants utilize the orthogonal Zernike polynomials. 

In this thesis we introduce a method of transforming a digital RGB image inside the unit circle onto a discrete orthogonal points system. Using this points system for the discretization of the QZMIs, we have achieved significant improvements in the image recognition and reconstruction capabilities of the method.
