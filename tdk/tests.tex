In this chapter we present the different tests that were performed to compare the capabilities of the old and new methods.

In total, four kinds of tests were conducted:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Invariance
	\item Image reconstruction
	\item Image recognition
	\item Template matching
\end{itemize}
All of these tests were run for both the old and new methods and the results have been compared.
